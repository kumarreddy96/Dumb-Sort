It developed by using one of the popular sorting algrothim i.e Bubble Sort.

In this project we have a java i.e Dumbsort inside dumbsort package.
This class contains main() method,parametrised constructor,shuffle() method and print()method.
The java program execution starts from the main() method of the program.
The main() method have a single dimensional array 
i.e (int[] array = {5,6,6,4,3})
By main() method we call parametrised constructor by passing above array as paramter.

Now we are in parametrised constructor
by this constructor we call a method i.e shuffle().

Now  we are executing shuffle() method
By this shuffle method we will swap the values iby using Bubble Sort algrothim.
In this shuffle method swap the values by using a temporary.
This method works based on some conditions if all excution is compeleted then return to return with some values i.e an array.

Now we back to parametrised constructor and starts excuting remaining code.
The constructor now the another method i.e print()
 Now we are inn print() method
 In print we just display the array which is sorted by shuffle method.
 Based on the length the array it will display the sorted array.
 After execution the print() methokd is go back parametrised constructor.
 
 Then parametrised constructor execution is completed then go back to main method execute is there any code is avaliable otherwise terminate the excecution of program.
